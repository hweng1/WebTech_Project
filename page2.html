        <p>
            ISTP (introverted, sensing, thinking, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types identified by the
            Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). People with ISTP personalities enjoy having time to think alone and are
            fiercely independent. ISTPs also love action, new experiences, hands-on activities, and the freedom to work
            at their own pace.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ISTPs enjoy taking things apart just to see how they work. They are logical and rational, but are more
            interested in practical applications than in abstract ideas. They love doing new things and can become bored
            with routines rather quickly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>KEY CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            People with an ISTP personality are results-oriented. When there is a problem, they want to quickly
            understand the underlying cause and implement some type of solution.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ISTPs enjoy new experiences and may often engage in thrill-seeking or even risk-taking behaviors. They often
            engage in risky or fast-paced hobbies such as motorcycling, hang gliding, bungee jumping, surfing, or ice
            hockey. In some cases, they may seek out adventure by choosing careers in areas such as racing, flying, or
            firefighting.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They prefer to make judgments based upon objective criteria rather than personal beliefs or values.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ISTPs are often described as quiet, but with an easygoing attitude towards others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ISTPs are not well attuned to the emotional states of others, and they can sometimes be seen as a bit
            insensitive. They also distance themselves from their own emotions, ignoring their feelings until they
            become overwhelming.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One common misconception about ISTPs is that they are the stoic, silent type. While they do tend to be
            reserved, this does not mean that they do not experience strong emotions. Instead, they are good at keeping
            a cool head, maintaining their objectivity, and coping with crisis.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Cognitive Functions</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The MBTI suggests that people possess a number of different cognitive functions (thinking, sensing, feeling,
            and intuition) that can then be directed inwards (introverted) or outwards (extraverted). The hierarchical
            arrangement of these functions is what makes up each individual's personality, the MBTI suggests.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Dominant: Introverted Thinking</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            ISTPs spend a great deal of time thinking and dealing with information in their own heads. This means they
            do not spend a great deal of time expressing themselves verbally, so they are often known as being quiet.
            It may seem like the ISTPs approach to decision-making is very haphazard, yet their actions are actually
            based upon careful observation and thought.
            They deal with the world rationally and logically, so they are often focused on things that seem practical
            and useful.
            Because they are so logical, ISTPs are good at looking at situations in an objective way and avoiding
            subjective or emotional factors when making decisions. People with this personality type can be difficult to
            get to know, often because they are focused so much on action and results rather than on emotions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Auxiliary: Extraverted Sensing</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            ISTPs prefer to focus on the present and take on things one day at a time. They often avoid making long-term
            commitments and would rather focus on the "here and now" rather than think about future plans and
            possibilities.
            ISTPs tend to be very logical and enjoy learning and understanding how things operate. They might take apart
            a mechanical device just to see how it works.
            While they are good at understanding abstract and theoretical information, they are not particularly
            interested in such things unless they can see some type of practical application.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Tertiary: Introverted Intuition</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            This function often operates largely unconsciously in the ISTP personality. While they are not usually
            interested in abstract ideas, they may take such concepts and try to turn them into action or practical
            solutions.
            It is this function that is behind the "gut feelings" that ISTP sometimes experience when making a decision.
            By synthesizing information brought in by the dominant and auxiliary functions, this aspect of personality
            may be responsible for sudden "aha" moments of insight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Inferior: Extraverted Feeling</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            This aspect of personality tends to operate in the background of the ISTP personality, but it can become
            more apparent during times of stress.
            During highly charged situations, ISTPs can sometimes lash out in sudden outbursts of emotion. They often
            ignore their own feelings until things reach a boiling over point, which can lead to displaying emotions in
            ways that can seem inappropriate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Personal Relationships</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            ISTPs are introverts and they tend to be quiet and reserved. They thrive on new experiences and dislike
            strict routines. In relationships, they are highly independent and do not like to feel controlled. Making
            commitments is difficult for the ISTP, but will put a lot of effort into relationships that hold their
            interest.
            They do not often share their emotions with other people. While they enjoy hearing what other people think,
            they frequently keep their own opinions to themselves. For these reasons, people sometimes describe ISTPs as
            difficult to get to know. They often find friends who enjoy similar hobbies as they do and enjoy spending
            time with these friends as they pursue these activities.
