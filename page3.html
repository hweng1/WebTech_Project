            ENTP is one of the 16 different personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.1 People
            with this personality type are often described as innovative, clever, and expressive. ENTPs are also known
            for being idea-oriented, which is why this personality type has been described as "the innovator," "the
            visionary," and "the debater."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ENTPs are less interested in the here-and-now details than they are in generating ideas and theories.
            Because of this, they sometimes tend to come up with one idea after another without actually going forward
            with plans and actions to bring their creative notions into fruition.
            According to psychologist David Keirsey, the creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, ENTPs are known as
            Rational Inventors. He suggests that the Rational personality type is rare, accounting for around five to
            10% of the population.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>KEY CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            ENTPs enjoy interacting with a wide variety of people. They are great conversationalists and love to engage
            other people in debates.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They are more focused on the future rather than on immediate details. They may start projects and never
            finish them because they are so focused on the big picture rather than the present needs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ENTPs enjoy being around other people, particularly if they are able to engage in a conversation or debate
            about something in which they are interested. They are usually fairly laid-back and easy to get along with.
            However, they can sometimes get so wrapped up in their ideas or plans that they lose sight of their close
            relationships.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They tend to reserve judgment. Instead of making a decision or committing to a course of action, they would
            prefer to wait and see what happens.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            ENTPs are immensely curious and focused on understanding the world around them. They are constantly
            absorbing new information and ideas and quickly arriving at conclusions. They are able to understand new
            things quite quickly.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One common myth about ENTPs is that they love to argue simply for the sake of arguing. While people with
            this personality type are often willing to play the devil's advocate at times, they enjoy debates as a way
            of exploring a topic, learning what other people believe, and helping others see the other side of the
            story.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Cognitive Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Based upon Carl Jung's theory of personality, the MBTI categorized personality types by their cognitive
            functions (intuition, thinking, sensing, and feeling) which can then be directed outwardly (extroverted) or
            inwardly (introverted). The hierarchical organization of these functions is what establishes each
            individual's primary pattern of behavior.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Dominant: Introverted Thinking</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            ENTPs tend to take in information quickly and are very open-minded.
            Once they have gathered this information, they spend time making connections between various complex and
            interwoven relationships.
            They are good at spotting connections that others might overlook and tend to be focused on possibilities.
            They have entrepreneurial minds and are always coming up with new and exciting ideas.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Auxiliary: Extraverted Sensing</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            This cognitive function is expressed in the ENTPs thinking process. People with this type of personality are
            more focused on taking in information about the world around them. When they do use this information to
            reach conclusions, they tend to be very logical.
            ENTPs are logical and objective. When making decisions, they place a greater weight on rational evidence
            instead of subjective, emotional information.
            This function works to help the ENTP understand all the information that comes in through the extroverted
            intuition function. This involves imposing logic and order to help make sense of many disparate ideas and
            pieces of information. ENTPs don't want to just understand that something works - they want to understand
            the why and how behind how things function.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Tertiary: Introverted Intuition</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            As a tertiary function, this aspect of personality may not be as well-developed or prominent.
            When developed, ENTPs can be social charmers who are able to get along well with others.
            When this aspect of personality is weaker, the ENTP may be insensitve to others and can even be seen as
            aloof or unkind.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Inferior: Extraverted Feeling</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The introverted sensing function is centered on understanding the past and often applying it to current
            experiences and future concerns.
            This is often a point of weakness for ENTP personalities. They are often focused more on possibilities and
            may fail to consider how past precedents may help predict outcomes.
            ENTPs also tend to overlook many of the more mundane details of daily life, especially if they are deeply
            involved in a project or plan.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Personal Relationships</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Since they are identified as extroverts, it may come as no surprise that ENTPs have very good people skills.
            They are skilled communicators and enjoy interacting with a wide circle of family, friends, and
            acquaintances. In conversations, other people often find them quick-witted.
            ENTPs will often engage in debates simply because they enjoy having a good battle of the wits. Sometimes,
            their love of debates lead ENTPs to take on the role of the devil's advocate, which can sometimes lead to
            conflicts with others who feel like they are being intentionally combative and antagonistic.
